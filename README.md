# Base of Recommendations

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) - Make sure `mongod` is running on the default port (27017).

### Tools Prerequisites
* NPM - Node.js package manage; should be installed when you install node.js.
* Bower - Web package manager. Installing [Bower](http://bower.io/) is simple when you have `npm`:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

### Optional [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)
* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).
```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.

## Troubleshooting
During install some of you may encounter some issues.

Most issues can be solved by one of the following tips, but if are unable to find a solution feel free to contact us via the repository issue tracker or the links provided below.

#### Update NPM, Bower or Grunt
Sometimes you may find there is a weird error during install like npm's *Error: ENOENT*. Usually updating those tools to the latest version solves the issue.

* Updating NPM:
```
$ npm update -g npm
```

* Updating Grunt:
```
$ npm update -g grunt-cli
```

* Updating Bower:
```
$ npm update -g bower
```

#### Cleaning NPM and Bower cache
NPM and Bower has a caching system for holding packages that you already installed.
We found that often cleaning the cache solves some troubles this system creates.

* NPM Clean Cache:
```
$ npm cache clean
```

* Bower Clean Cache:
```
$ bower cache clean
```

#### Installation problems on Windows 8 / 8.1
Some of Mean.io dependencies uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) with supported Python version 2.7.x. So if you see an error related to node-gyp rebuild follow next steps:

1. install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/download/details.aspx?id=34673)
3. fire NPM update
````
$ npm update -g
````

## Configuration
All configuration is specified in the [config](/config/) folder, through the [env](config/env/) files, and is orchestrated through the [meanio](https://github.com/linnovate/mean-cli) NPM module. Here you will need to specify your application name, database name, and hook up any social app keys if you want integration with Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, or Google.

### Environmental Settings

There is a shared environment config: __all__.
* __root__ - This the default root path for the application.
* __port__ - DEPRECATED to __http.port__ or __https.port__.
* __http.port__ - This sets the default application port.
* __https__ - These settings are for running HTTPS / SSL for a secure application.
  * __port__ - This sets the default application port for HTTPS / SSL. If HTTPS is not used then is value is to be set to __false__ which is the default setting. If HTTPS is to be used the standard HTTPS port is __443__. 
  * __ssl.key__ - The path to public key.
  * __ssl.cert__ - The path to certificate.

There are three environments provided by default: __development__, __test__, and __production__.

Each of these environments has the following configuration options:

* __db__ - This is where you specify the MongoDB / Mongoose settings
  * __url__ - This is the url/name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __mean-dev__ for the development environment.
  * __debug__ - Setting this option to __true__ will log the output all Mongoose executed collection methods to your
console.  The default is set to __true__ for the development environment.
  * __options__ - These are the database options that will be passed directly to mongoose.connect in the __production__ environment: [server, replset, user, pass, auth, mongos] (http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) or read [this] (http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html#mongoclient-connect-options) for more information.
* __app.name__ - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.
* __Social OAuth Keys__ - Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter. You can specify your own social application keys here for each platform:
  * __clientID__
  * __clientSecret__
  * __callbackURL__
* __emailFrom__ - This is the from email address displayed when sending an email.
* __mailer__ - This is where you enter your email service provider, username and password.

To run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:

    $ NODE_ENV=test grunt

If you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:

    $ NODE_ENV=test node server

To simply run tests

    $ npm test

> NOTE: Running Node.js applications in the __production__ environment enables caching, which is disabled by default in all other environments.
